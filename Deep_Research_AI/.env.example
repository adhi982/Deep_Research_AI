# ===== DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS =====
# For local development:
# 1. Copy this file to one of the following (in order of precedence):
#    - .env.development.local (for development-specific overrides, git-ignored)
#    - .env.local (for local overrides, git-ignored)
#    - .env.development (for development defaults, can be committed)
#    - .env (for defaults, can be committed)
#
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
#
# 3. DO NOT commit files containing actual credentials to git
#    (ensure .env.local and .env.*.local are in your .gitignore)
#
# For web deployment:
# 1. When deploying to platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS:
#    - Set environment variables through the platform's dashboard
#    - Make sure these variables are exposed to the client using appropriate prefixes (EXPO_PUBLIC_)
#    - For Vercel: Use the Environment Variables section in project settings
#    - For Netlify: Use the Environment Variables section in site settings
#    - For AWS Amplify: Use the Environment Variables section in app settings
#
# 2. Use platform-specific build-time environment integration:
#    - Vercel: Environment variables are automatically available at build time
#    - Netlify: Environment variables are automatically available at build time
#    - For other platforms, you may need to add a build step to create an .env file
#
# SECURITY NOTE: 
# When using EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix, these values will be embedded in your client bundle.
# Only use this for non-sensitive information or public keys meant for client-side use.
# For truly sensitive information, use server-side environment variables.
# 
# The Supabase anon key is designed to be public, but still treat it with care.

# then in app.json's extra section, and finally in process.env.
